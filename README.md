# 👋 Hi, I’m Loshan Sundaramoorthy

I'm a hands-on software developer who enjoys building reliable systems that just work - from secure APIs used by enterprise clients to native C++ applications with raw socket logic.

## 💻 What I Work On

- 🛠️ **Backend Development**
  - C#, .NET (Framework + Core), MSSQL, REST APIs
  - Automation scripts and system integration for large-scale B2B data workflows
  - Built secure authentication + rate-limited APIs used in production

- 🧠 **Low-Level & Native Apps**
  - C++ projects using ImGui, raw sockets, and Raylib  
  - Built a work-in-progress **Game Boy emulator** in C++ to explore CPU opcodes, memory mapping, and basic PPU rendering 

- 🧪 **Experiments & Tools**
  - Markdown IDE prototypes, interpreters, and 2.5D raycasters (SDL2)  
  - SQLite-powered desktop apps (MAUI)  
  - Internal productivity tools for teams and small businesses  

### Web & Frontend

- **DevRealm** - A local-first knowledge hub for developers with a React + Chakra UI frontend, live Markdown preview, tagging, and search. Backend is a C# API with SQLite.
- **CronFleet** - A task orchestration platform built with Node.js (Fastify) and PostgreSQL. REST API for creating and running jobs, plus a web UI for monitoring runs across tenants.

### Systems & Low-Level

- **Evolution Webservice** - Secure C# API for tele/data lookups with a clean admin interface, authentication, rate limiting and flexible search logic.
- **Raycaster Engine** - 2.5D raycasting engine in C/SDL2 with textured walls, movement, and custom rendering - inspired by classic Wolfenstein-style engines.
