# 👋 Hi, I’m Loshan Sundaramoorthy

I'm a hands-on software developer who enjoys building reliable systems that just work — from secure APIs used by enterprise clients to native C++ applications with raw socket logic.

Currently working remotely from Germany for a Danish company. My work is practical, performance-minded, and always evolving.

## 💻 What I Work On

- 🛠️ **Backend Development**
  - C#, .NET (Framework + Core), MSSQL, REST APIs
  - Automation scripts and system integration for large-scale B2B data workflows
  - Built secure authentication + rate-limited APIs used in production

- 🧠 **Low-Level & Native Apps**
  - C++ projects with DirectX, ImGui, raw sockets (no external FTP libs)
  - Hooking (D3D11), memory management, reverse engineering tools
  - Built an experimental Lossless Scaling-style app with GUI and config support

- 🧪 **Experiments & Tools**
  - Markdown IDE plugins, interpreters, 2.5D raycasters (SDL2)
  - SQLite apps with MAUI frontends
  - Internal productivity tools for teams and small businesses

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **🔌 Evolution Webservice** – Secure C# API for data, including a clean admin interface and flexible search logic  
- **🕹️ Raycaster Engine** – A 2.5D raycasting engine built in C with SDL2, featuring textured walls, player movement, and custom rendering logic — inspired by classic Wolfenstein-style engines
- **📊 DevRealm** – Local-first knowledge hub for developers with search, Markdown preview, and tagging  

## 📌 Currently

- Open to **full-time** roles starting now  
- Part time work
- Always up for solving a tough bug or shipping something useful
